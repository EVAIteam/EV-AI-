EV Coin

EV Coin is a cryptocurrency focused on helping investors make informed decisions using the concept of **Expected Value (EV)**. By factoring in probabilities and potential outcomes, EV Coin offers low-risk investment opportunities through staking and prediction-based rewards.

 Features

- Staking Rewards: Stake your coins and earn rewards at a fixed rate.
- Prediction Rewards: Earn rewards based on predicted market outcomes and probabilities.
- Expected Value Calculation: Rewards are determined using EV calculations to guide informed decisions.
- Low-Risk Investment: Designed for users looking for risk-conscious investment strategies.

 Code Overview

The code enables basic functionalities for managing coin holders, staking, and rewarding based on predictions. It includes:

- `stake(address, amount)`: Stake coins and earn rewards.
- `predict_and_reward(address, probability, outcome)`: Make predictions and earn rewards based on expected value.
- `add_holder(address, amount)`: Add new holders or increase their balance.
- `get_balance(address)`: Check the balance of any holder.
- `get_total_supply()`: View the total supply of EV Coin.

 Example Usage

```python
ev_coin = EVCoin(name="EV Coin", initial_supply=1000000, staking_reward_rate=0.05, prediction_reward_rate=0.10)

# Adding initial holders
ev_coin.add_holder("holder1", 1000)
ev_coin.add_holder("holder2", 500)

# Staking
ev_coin.stake("holder1", 500)

# Prediction and Reward
probability = 0.7
outcome = 100
ev_coin.predict_and_reward("holder2", probability, outcome)

# Checking balances
print(f"Holder1 Balance: {ev_coin.get_balance('holder1')}")
print(f"Holder2 Balance: {ev_coin.get_balance('holder2')}")
print(f"Total Supply: {ev_coin.get_total_supply()}")
